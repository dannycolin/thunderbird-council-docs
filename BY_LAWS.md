# Thunderbird Council By-Laws

## Thunderbird Council Election Process

The current election process is detailed below.

1. A list of persons eligible to vote (the "electors") shall be established by the existing Council, see the section entitled “Electorate” below for how this is done. The names of the electors will be made public.
2. The list of electors will be entered into a private mailing list (currently known as tb-election) that will be created for the purpose of managing the Thunderbird Council election. All people with voting rights will be added to that list, and any discussion of the nominees and candidates, and any specific instructions on how to vote, will be distributed through that list and only through that list. Once the discussion period has started, all members of the list can post freely to the list (subject only to moderation for abusive posts) to discuss any issues relevant to the election.
3. Persons on the electorate list who desire to stand for election should send their self-announcement to the list, titled: “Standing for Election: <name>”, stating in the body of the email:
   1. name;
   2. current professional affiliation (if any);
   3. a statement summarising their contributions to Thunderbird; and
   4. a personal statement.
4. It is the responsibility of the person desiring to stand to make sure their message makes it to the list. No late self-announcements will be accepted for any reason.
5. In the case there are more than two people nominated from the same professional affiliation, a pre-election will take place first, and the two winners will continue to the real election. The 'Mozilla Corporation', the 'Mozilla Foundation', and ‘MZLA Technologies’ are (considered) separate companies for purposes of "professional affiliation”.
6. Electors shall vote for Council members from the list of those standing for election, with the specific method and process selected by a neutral third-party observer.
7. The voting process shall select a Council of seven members, each with a one-year term. Voting will occur on an external, secure voting-as-a-service platform. If more than seven people stand for election, voting will be done using “ranked choice”, with conversion of the individual choices into an elected council done using the Scottish STV method. If seven or fewer persons stand for election, then the voting shall consist of a simple yes or no to accept or decline the entire slate as the elected Council.
   
### Thunderbird Project Election Observer

**Description:**

The primary functions of the election "observer" during the election process are as follows:
1. Be an impartial party.
2. Privately or publicly raise concerns if any person - participant, election manager, or council - acts improperly. And may also directly communicate with the council and the public.
3. Approve the documented election process as proposed by the council as being fair and correct.
4. Assures that the documented election process is actually properly applied throughout the election period.
5. Works closely with the council appointed election manager(s).
6. Regarding moderation and the election mailing list, discussion period, and participant conduct - the observer doesn't actually setup, run and moderate the mailing; that is done by council appointed "manager(s)" who build/implement/manage the election process . _The observer should have all the powers that the managers have AND be able to see all the moderation activity, all emails and all communications_ - to be able to fulfill their responsibility of observing and ensuring the process is properly and fairly applied.
7. (In this step, the observer _is the primary driver_) Be the ONLY person to administer the voting service, and run the vote. There must be no possibility for any other person to influence the election.
8. Announces the vote result.

It should also be noted, that CPG is to be observed throughout the process. It is not the observer's job to enforce CPG, but it would be entirely proper to be involved in determining if CPG violations have occurred. The observer will need to engage with the CPG team if and when necessary during the process.

**The number of hours:**

This depends on the amount of discussion and controversy, if any, during the election period.

Baseline 5-10 hours in the 5-6 week period, if there are no election hurdles.

Top end, 15-20 hours

**Pay:**

This is a voluntary position, with non-monetary compensation.

### Electorate

Contributors are eligible to vote in Thunderbird Council elections if they fulfill the following requirements:

> Elector qualification is 10 hours of contribution per year of involvement in the project, with a three year look back. Thus, if someone first became involved: three years ago then the expected contribution is at least 30 hours, if two years ago then at least 20 hours, and if one year ago or less then at least 10 hours. Contributors may self-nominate, and on request must submit examples that illustrate their level of involvement.
